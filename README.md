# Task Manager App

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## Approach

Tasks are sorted by priority using a simple sorting algorithm. Priorities are mapped to numerical values (`high` = 1, `medium` = 2, `low` = 3) to enable sorting. The app uses server-side rendering to load tasks initially and uses state management to handle task actions like adding, editing, and deleting.
